# Calorimeter Data Visualization

This project was developed for a company from the compressor industry. 

They run over 20000 compressor tests with more than 20 different calorimeters. These devices simulate the conditions of a refrigerator, testing the compressors in different operating points. However, each of them has a specific limit of applications and when this point is achieved it results in an error. 

To visualize each calorimeters limit, the software was created to display past test results, giving to the user the information needed to define better testing points to every calorimeter.

Unfortunately, due to confidentiality, the code cannot be posted. The software interface is shown in the pdf files.
